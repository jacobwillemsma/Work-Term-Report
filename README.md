pd2report
=========

A PD2 report template that incorporates all formatting necessary for students in the course, so that they can focus on the actual content instead of worrying about less important details. To begin, simply compile `report.tex` following the instructions in the comments. 

# How to Begin

## Prerequisites

You need to have _LaTeX_ installed on your computer _or_ you can use an online tool such as [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/). If you're using ShareLatex, then you need to download this project as a `.zip` and then upload that as a new project on their website.

If you don't have LaTeX installed, then you need to install it on your computer:

* [TeX Live for Linux](http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
* [MacTeX for Mac](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)
* [ProTeXt for Windows](http://www.tug.org/protext/)

## Instructions

Open `report.tex` and follow the instructions in sequence from the beginning of the file. Start by entering some information like your faculty, name, term, student id number, etc. Right now the file has a lot of random gibberish just to show what the final product will look like with your report inside of it, just remove all of the lipsum lines it tells you to. Also, as far as adding tables go, right now you can use a custom command called `\myTable` and a link to an image of a table, but you may want to learn proper Latex syntax to do a proper looking table.

If the course ever changes its guidelines or rubric, just make a pull request and I'll add whatever changes you want to make to this project.

Hope this helps! :)
